#American-Express-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-in-R
**American Express Credit Card Default Prediction using Random Forest in R**

This repository contains code and resources for performing predictive analysis on American Express credit card default using the Random Forest algorithm in R.

**Overview**

Predicting credit card defaults is crucial for financial institutions to manage risk effectively. This project demonstrates how to use the Random Forest method to predict whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their payments.

**Features**

    Data preprocessing: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning.
    Model building: Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for credit card default prediction.
    Model evaluation: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics.
    Visualizations: Plots and graphs for better understanding of data and results.

**Getting Started**

    Clone this repository using git clone [link](https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-default-prediction.git).
    Navigate to the project directory: cd credit-card-default-prediction.
    Install the required R packages. These are randomForest, datasets, caret and dplyr.
    Open and run the R script in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, link to the full dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/data).

**Usage**

Modify the data preprocessing steps, hyperparameters, and other configurations in the /Code/RandomForest.R script as needed. Run the script to execute the Random Forest model and obtain predictions.

**Results**

The model's performance and predictions will be displayed in the R environment. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will provide insights into the model's effectiveness.
